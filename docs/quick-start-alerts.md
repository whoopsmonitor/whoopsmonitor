# Quick Start - Alerts
As always, we have to add a Docker image the same way we add for the check. So search in the menu on the left for the `Docker Images` item.

<img src="/docs/img/quick-start/menu-docker-images.png" alt="image" width="294" />

Add a new image, but now select the type of `Alert`. I decided to go with the [alert to Teams](https://github.com/whoopsmonitor/whoopsmonitor-alert-teams) for our test purposes.

When you save the new image, wait for a minute until the little grey circle turns into a green one. Now you're ready to add a new alert.

## New Alert
The setup is similar to the process we used to [create a new check](./quick-start.md).
